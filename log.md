<!--
### Day 0: February 30, 2016 (Example 1)
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 0: February 1, 2018 

**Today's Progress:** Setting up 100 Days of Code repository.

**Thoughts:** Excited to begin this challenge, I hope to maintain consistency and grow my coding skills. I'm progressing on python and other interests like arduino.

### Day 1: February 2, 2018 
**Today's Progress:** Getting familiar with micropython.

**Thoughts:** Some introduction to micropython which is a scaled down version of python for microcontrollers. Hope to come up with a project soon.

### Day 2: February 3, 2018 
**Today's Progress:** Setting micropython on nodemcu.

**Thoughts**: Never thought of the capabilities of running python on a microcontroller but it's quite amazing. I was able to run python and also setup rshell which is a great micropython shell.

### Day 3: February 4, 2018 
**Today's Progress:** Running Micropython script on nodemcu 

**Thoughts:** I was able to add main.py script on the nodemcu that holds code you want to run once the board boots up. I implemented a simple blink led script.
